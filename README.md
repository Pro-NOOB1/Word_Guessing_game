🎚️ Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard

💡 Hint System: One free letter reveal per game

🔁 Restart Option to play again anytime

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed

tkinter module (comes pre-installed with standard Python)

1. How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-guessing-game.git
cd word-guessing-game
2. Run the game:
python word_guess_game.py


🛠️ How It Works
User selects a category and difficulty level.

A random word is picked based on the selection.

User guesses letters; correct guesses reveal parts of the word.

User has limited turns depending on difficulty:

Easy: 15

Medium: 12

Hard: 10

A Hint button reveals one unrevealed letter.

Game ends when the word is fully guessed or turns run out.
